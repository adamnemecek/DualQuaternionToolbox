
In order to install the Toolbox please do the following steps :

1) Copy the folder containing this file in the directory of your choice. 
   If you change the name of the folder please do not put a name with 
   space in it, for instance 'toolbox_JSR' and not 'toolbox JSR'.
2) Open Matlab, select File > Set Path...
   In the window that opens, select button 'Add with Subfolders...'
   Add the folder. In order not to re-do this at each start of Matlab      
   click on button 'Save' before clicking on 'Close'.

   Manually you can use, in the command line,
   >> addpath <pathFolder>    
   for this folder and its subfolders.
   In order to save this for further Matlab sessions type
   >> savepath

3) The Toolbox and its functions should now be available from any
   directory. 
   From another directory, type 
   >> help('<nameOfFolder>')
   if the names of all the functions are hyperlinks (in blue and
   underlined) it should have worked properly.

Note : 
- The Toolbox has been tested on Matlab 2009a and 2010a. Nevertheless
  it is still a beta version, please report any bug, comment or suggestion
